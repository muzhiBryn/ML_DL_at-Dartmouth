       "[' (CNN) Concerns are growing over the potential for violence in Myanmar as  anti-coup protesters  urge supporters to take to the streets en masse, in defiance of a  growing military presence .  Protests  and civil disobedience movements  against the military coup  on February 1 have been the biggest in decades, with thousands calling for  ousted  civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be released from detention and  power be handed  back to civilian control.  A mas rally in downtown Yangon was called for Wednesday, after a second charge was  filed against  Suu Kyi Tuesday. Her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said that she had been charged in relation to a national disaster law, in addition to an earlier count under the country\\'s import and export act.  \"Let\\'s gather in millions to take down the dictators,\" activist Khin Sandar wrote on Facebook, according to Reuters.  Kyi Toe, a senior member of Suu Kyi\\'s National League for Democracy (NLD) party who has not been arrested, said: \"Let\\'s march en masse. Let\\'s show our force against the coup government that has destroyed the future of youth, the future of our country.\" The United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar,   Tom Andrews ,  said he was \"terrified\" of the potential for violence if the planned mass protests and military troops converge.   \"I fear that Wednesday has the potential for violence on a greater scale in Myanmar than we have seen since the illegal takeover of the government on February 1,\" said Andrews.  Andrews said he had received reports of soldiers being transported into Yangon from outlying regions.  \"In the past, such troop movements preceded killings, disappearances, and detentions on a mass scale,\" he said. \"We could be on the precipice of the military committing even greater crimes against the people of Myanmar.\" Soldiers from the Myanmar military\\'s light infantry divisions (LIDs) -- long documented to be engaged in human rights abuses -- have been seen in the country\\'s largest city, Yangon in the past week.  These elite counter-insurgency forces come under direct orders from Myanmar military\\'s commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and they have been accused of human rights violations, carrying out violent campaigns against ethnic minority armed groups and civilians, and have a history of brutally crushing protests. Conflict-ready infantry troops trained to fight ethnic rebels in the jungles and mountains and who now appear armed on city streets is cause for worry, analysts say.  \"These light infantry divisions, these are the ones to be concerned about,\" said Human Rights Watch researcher on crisis and conflict Richard Weir. \"These are the kinds of units that can be deployed very quickly to city streets.\" Weir described the LIDs as an \"expeditionary force that goes out when other units aren\\'t able to handle a certain situation.\" It is unclear how big of a presence these soldiers have in Yangon. So far clashes between security forces and protesters have been isolated skirmishes.  Brutal history The 77th Light Infantry Division, identified by their armband insignias and seen in Yangon this week, were reportedly deployed last year in western Rakhine state and is engaged in operations against the Arakan Army   -- a Rakhine militant group -- there,  according  to local media.  The LID also has a history of brutally suppressing protests. Human Rights Watch  documented  that the 77th was part of four main army command units that violently cracked down on a  monk-led uprising in 2007 , known as the Saffron Revolution. During the crackdown in Yangon, soldiers of the 77th were alleged to have blocked those trying to flee and opened fire into the crowd, according to Human Rights Watch. The international rights group said the 77th LID was \"deeply implicated in many of the violent incidents and killings documented\" and was \"actively engaged in the violent suppression of demonstrations.\" Analysts say one reason for the deployment of these frontline combat units could be that they are easily transportable and often move around the country. But also that their presence sends a message.   \"The LIDs have a very nasty reputation and I think that at the very least, people will recognize and have recognized their presence,\" Weir said. \"The increased military presence period is clearly something that\\'s meant to demonstrate resolve, and to intimidate. This is not something we saw on the first week after the coup.\" Other LID units have been  accused  of spearheading the violent campaign against the  Rohingya ethnic community  in Rakhine state. More than 700,000 Rohingya people fled Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh in 2016 and 2017, many with reports of horrific crimes such as gang rape, extrajudicial killings, arson and torture. In 2018, the US government  sanctioned  the 33rd LID for serious human rights abuses in Rakhine. The generals have been accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. The case is ongoing.  The Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, is also fighting some of the world\\'s longest civil wars in the ethic states against rebel armed groups. Tatmadaw troops have long been documented by various human rights groups of repeated abuses such as using rape as a weapon of war, and other forms of sexual violence, extrajudicial killings, torture, forced labor and conscription against civilians.   Mass protests Since the coup, hundreds of thousands of people have protested or carried our civil disobedience campaigns in major cities across Myanmar, calling for generals to give back power to Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The NLD claimed an overwhelming victory in elections in November, taking 83% of the vote, which granted it another five years in government, but the military alleged widespread voter fraud and used this to justify seizing power.  Yangon residents have reported a palpable fear for their safety after dark, with many scared they will be dragged out of their houses by police in nighttime raids, or are terrified of reports of arson and crime following the release of thousands of prisoners in an amnesty last Friday. Widespread internet shutdowns at night have heightened the fear.  One journalist in Yangon, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of arrest, said rights defenders and reporters are struggling to let the people know what is happening. \"Journalists are in remote working and in hiding as they are scared of night arrests and their homes going to be raided. They can be arrested anytime for what they are reporting although (it\\'s the) truth,\" the reporter said. Hundreds of people have been arrested since the coup, and most held without charge, according to the United Nations human rights office. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPPB) said at least 452 people have been detained in relation to the coup.  \"There is a systematic move right now to just scare the living daylights out of people. First of all, you\\'ve got to remember, put this in context, this is a very brutal military, and it shows no reservations whatsoever of massacring protesters protesting for democracy in the past,\" said UN rapporteur Andrews.  By day, protesters -- many of them young people -- remain defiant.  Activist Myo Htet, who could be seen with a microphone rallying crowds at a protest last week, said demonstrators were fighting for their future.  \"We are not fighting for one leader, we are fighting for the country, we are fighting for our future, we are fighting for our next generation,\" he said. \"No matter how nasty they are, no matter how they gunshot, the tanks are powerful, at the end of the day, I believe that we people are the most powerful. If we unite.\" Myanmar had suffered under half a century   of isolationist military rule with a series of martial dictators who enforced their will through fear and brutality. In 2011, the military chiefs put in place a plan that would permit the country to hold elections, liberalize the economy, and transition into a semi-democracy while still maintaining their authority. It paved the way for Suu Kyi to be elected in 2015.  But the trauma of military rule is still carried by many in the country.  \"Throughout my life, I grew up in the dark era, we were so afraid of everything. We\\'ve grown up in the military junta, and I cannot pass that kind of terrible experience to my next generation,\" said Myo Htet.  \"We\\'re fighting to get rid of the military dictatorship from Myanmar once and for all, this is our fight. Yeah, we are fighting for that.\" CNN\\'s Bex Wright and Richard Roth contributed reporting.',\n",
       " ' (CNN) President Joe Biden  would only commit to a return to normal by next Christmas during a  CNN town hall on Tuesday , saying he did not want to boost Americans\\' hopes  when he could not be certain of a still-early vaccine rollout . The prediction of nearly another year in pandemic-dampened conditions was admittedly not optimistic. But Biden still said it was as good as he could offer with any level of confidence. \"As my mother would say, with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors, that by next Christmas I think we\\'ll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today,\" Biden said. \"A year from now, I think that there\\'ll be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, having to wear a mask.\" He added: \"I don\\'t want to over promise anything here.\"  Speaking during his first outing from Washington after nearly a month in office, Biden sought to make a clean break with Donald Trump -- whom he said is his only living predecessor not to reach out in support -- including by making what he said were realistic predictions about the pandemic. Biden described a national fixation on Trump that, now that the 45th President\\'s second impeachment trial is over, he was intent on breaking.  \"For four years, all that\\'s been in the news is Trump,\" he said. \"The next four years, I want to make sure all the news is the American people. I\\'m tired of talking about Trump.\" His primary goal in Milwaukee was to pitch his massive Covid-19 relief plan, which he insisted must \"go big.\" But pressed on the foremost question for many Americans -- when life can be restored to what it was before the coronavirus began ravaging the country -- he aimed low. \"Be careful not to predict things you don\\'t know for certain because then you\\'ll be held accountable,\" he said, describing the advice he said he\\'d received on predicting the trajectory of the pandemic. Refocusing on Covid-19  No longer encumbered by his predecessor\\'s trial and eager to seize the national spotlight, Biden\\'s first work trip outside Washington signaled his intent on making a  public sales pitch for his agenda . Aside from Covid-19 relief, Biden affirmed his support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said more money was needed for police departments and insisted he wouldn\\'t interfere in the Justice Department\\'s work. Aides said beforehand the President, known for his outgoing style with voters, was eager to escape the White House, which he described during the event as a \"gilded cage.\" That style was on ample display, including when  he sought to reassure a second-grader  who feared catching Covid-19. \"Don\\'t be scared, honey,\" he told her. \"You\\'re going to be fine\" But the event was mostly focused on the substance of his plans to provide relief to the American people after nearly a yearlong pandemic. He offered a more bullish timeline for vaccines, touting a scaled-up vaccination program he claimed was woefully inadequate when he entered the White House. \"There was nothing in the refrigerator, literally and figuratively,\" Biden said, promising there would be enough vaccines available for nearly every American by the end of July, even if the process of actually administering them might take longer. He said teachers should move ahead in the line to receive shots in order to reopen many classrooms five days a week by the end of April, attempting to clarify an administration stance he acknowledged had become muddled over the last week. Biden said he wanted kindergarten through eighth grade schools open five days a week, and suggested some schools should remain open over the summer to make up for lost time. He said he believed his goal could be accomplished within his first 100 days in office.  \"We have a significant percentage of them being able to be open,\" he said. \"My guess is they\\'re probably going to be pushing to open all summer.\"  Pressed on how he would return students to classrooms, Biden said he would emphasize getting vaccines to teachers: \"I think we should be vaccinating teachers. We should move them up in the hierarchy,\" he said. But he acknowledged there has been miscues coming from his administration on reopening schools, saying it was a \"mistake\" to say his goal was only to reopen classrooms one day a week, which his press secretary said last week. His primary goal, however, was to promote his American Recovery Plan, his debut legislative effort. White House aides insist the $1.9 trillion proposal is popular with a wide swath of Americans, including Republicans, even though Biden has not secured support from any GOP senators. By taking his pitch on the road, and fielding questions from Americans, he hoped to highlight the relief the plan would bring nearly a year into the pandemic. \"Now is the time to be spending, now is the time to go big,\" he said. The package includes direct payments to families of up to $1,400, money for state and local governments and more funding for vaccination efforts. The White House hopes for final passage of the plan by mid-March, when certain unemployment benefits expire. House committees have begun writing individual sections of the measure before it is compiled into one bill. Democrats are using a procedural process that would allow it to pass by a simple Senate majority -- which the Democrats hold -- rather than requiring 60 votes to overcome an all-but-certain GOP objection.  New normal  The visit to Milwaukee is Biden\\'s first real trip as president, though he did travel home to Wilmington two weekends ago. He flew aboard the iconic jumbo jet typically used as Air Force One for the first time after using a smaller model to fly to Delaware.  Employing the traditional symbols  of the presidency to advance his agenda is one of the perks of the job; Biden will use it again on Thursday when he travels to Kalamazoo, Michigan, to tour a Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility. He admitted on Tuesday that he was in awe of the White House, which he said exuded history. Despite serving as vice president for eight years, he said he\\'d spent almost no time in the presidential residence on the third floor of the White House. He said it was an adjustment to have a full-time staff of \"decent\" people whose job is to serve him. \"I find myself extremely self-conscious,\" he said. The famously gregarious politician had been itching to get out of Washington and engage with the public, interactions that have been limited amidst the ongoing pandemic. A senior official said Tuesday\\'s trip would likely be the first of several as Biden continues to drum up support for the relief package. Typically, new presidents lay out their legislative priorities in an address to a joint session of Congress, a State of the Union-like speech carried live on television and closely watched for signals of the administration\\'s priorities. Biden still intends to deliver such a speech once the Covid-19 relief package is passed, according to the White House, but doesn\\'t expect it to happen this month.  That\\'s later than typical, leaving the town hall and other upcoming events as Biden\\'s primary platform for advancing his agenda. ',\n",
       " ' (CNN) President Joe Biden  at a Tuesday  CNN town hall  sought to reassure a second grader worried about getting Covid-19, telling her that young children are the \"safest group of people in the whole world.\"  \"Don\\'t be scared, honey. Don\\'t be scared. You\\'re going to be fine, and we\\'re going to make sure mommy\\'s fine, too,\" he said.  Jessica Salas, a graphic designer from Milwaukee, told Biden that her two young children often ask her about whether they will get Covid-19 and die. She stood next to her 8-year-old daughter as she spoke about how the pandemic is especially frightening for children who don\\'t fully understand what is happening.  \"Kids don\\'t get Covid very often. It\\'s unusual for that to happen. They don\\'t -- the evidence so far is children aren\\'t the people most likely to get Covid,\" Biden said.  Salas said her children would like to know when they will be able to get the vaccine, but Biden said, \"We haven\\'t even done tests yet on children as to whether or not the certain vaccines would work or not work or what is needed.\" Though fewer children experience severe illness from the virus than adults, one question that has loomed large, especially for those grappling with decisions about reopening schools and day cares, is exactly what role children play in the transmission of the virus. The President had  said earlier in the evening  that \"there are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick-and-mortar building,\" before pointing to the administration\\'s guidance on smaller classroom pods and an accelerated timeline for K-8 schooling compared to high school and college. Additionally, Biden said, \"I think that we should be vaccinating teachers. We should move them up in the hierarchy as well.\" At least 28 states and Washington, DC, have started allowing all or some teachers and school staff to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Though some states have announced they are prioritizing teachers, vaccine availability remains a concern across the country. There are 22 states where teachers are still not eligible to receive the vaccine as a specific group -- although some educators might fall into the current age group that state is vaccinating. CNN\\'s Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report. ',\n",
